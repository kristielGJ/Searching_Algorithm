# Searching_Algorithm
Algorithm's module course work, programed algorithms for finding the longest word, unique count, etc of some data. (see pdf). I achieved 95%, see marks in .txt file

Marks:
longestWord: 25/25
This method produces correct answers on all tests, with the expected cost.

countUnique: 20/25
This method produces correct answers on all tests, but it uses O(n)
space, because it copies the list.  This is unnecessary, because we are
told that the list is ordered, which means that equal strings will be
next to each other, so it suffices to look at the previous entry.

findElement: 25/25
This method is a correct implementation of binary search, producing
correct answers on all tests, with the expected cost.

countGreaterOrEqual: 25/25
This method uses a correct implementation of the second variant of binary
search, producing correct answers on all tests, with the expected cost.

Total mark: 95/100
